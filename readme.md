# watr

Set of experiments with wasm text format.

Main goal is to get very fluent with wasm text and to know it from within.

Experiments:

* [x] global read/write use in function
* [x] scopes: refer, goto
* [x] stack: understanding named and full references
* [x] memory: reading/writing global memory
* [x] memory: creating arrays on the go
* [x] memory: passing pointer to a function
* [x] benchmark array setting agains js loop
  â†’ it's faster almost twice
