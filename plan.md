## plan

* [x] Basic compilation examples from wasm book
  * [x] Make sure they're compilable
* [x] Parsing samples from wat-compiler
* [x] Remove subscript, use own parsing loop
* [ ] Avoid duplicating function signatures
* [ ] Compilation samples from wat-compiler
* [ ] Normalize tree in parser, not in compiler - keep compiler small & fast
* [ ] Basic parsing instructions from mdn & examples
* [ ] Benchmark against wabt, wat-compiler
* [ ] Build script

## Backlog

* make repl support switch of compiler
* wat-based wat-compiler
