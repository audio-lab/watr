## plan

* [x] Basic compilation examples from wasm book
  * [x] Make sure they're compilable
* [x] Parsing samples from wat-compiler
* [x] Remove subscript, use own parsing loop
* [x] Avoid duplicating function signatures
* [x] Compilation samples from wat-compiler
* [ ] Examples tests - existing & wat-compiler ones (ideally find failing table)
* [x] Normalize tree in parser, not in compiler - keep compiler small & fast
* [x] Basic parsing instructions from mdn & examples
* [x] Benchmark against wabt, wat-compiler
* [x] Build script
* [x] Test: assert function;
* [x] make sure compiler doesn't modify tree
* [ ] Recognize all number formats
* [ ] Externref types;
* [ ] Named/multiple memory;
* [ ] Named/multiple tables;
* [ ] Relax no-inline limitation?
  ~ many examples use loop ... end, br 0 and other simple inliners
  ~ from code point things coming in loop/block node are not arguments, they're immediates-ish, or "body"

## Backlog

* make repl support switch of compiler
* wat-based wat-compiler
